# blooket-hack
not funtional right now, originally made by gbasil but was discontinued by him, so i have it here
the hack includes many different hacks, and was very useful. sadly the creator discontinued it due to blooket owner not liking it being used, so if anybody can figure out how to make  it so you do not need to update the code every day then the hack would be very useful
the hack is a bookmarklet, which (for those that don't know) is javascript code that can be copy and pasted into a bookmark in place of the link. in front of the code you must type "javascript:"
